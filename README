SOME EXPERIMENTS WITH S5P DATA
==============================


INTRODUCTION
------------

Sentinel 5P "precussor" is equipped with the multi-spectral TROPOMI instrument.
It will be complemented in a few years by the two "real" Sentinel 5 satellites,
of higher resolution.

It acquires daily optical nadir images of around 7x7 km resolution (more or
less, depending on the spectral band).  The main application is the daily
monitoring of atmospheric chemistry at a global scale.

The data is available in different forms.  The L1B product is an hyperspectral
image of about 35GB covering a north-south 2000km strip with 4000 spectral bands
ranging from UV to SWIR.  The L2 product is a summary of some radiometric
indices extracted from the L1B image, representing the concentrations of a few
cases in atmosphere (O3, NO2, etc.).

Each product is released twice.  First, with minimal but very fast processing
just after the acquisition.  Second, with high-quality processing and very
precise calibration a few days later.  There is maybe a possibility of
arbitrage in extracting just a part of the data (very localized in time and in
frequency) at a high quality and immediately.


L1B DATA
--------

The TROPOMI instrument has 8 multi-spectral "bands", where each band has about
500 spectral samples per pixel.  In the nominal RADIANCE acquisition mode they
have the following characteristics:

band	type	width	height	pd	size
1	UV	77	3246	497	1.0GB
2	UV	448	3246	497	5.6GB
3	UVIS	450	3246	497	5.7GB
4	UVIS	450	3246	497	5.7GB
5	NIR	448	3246	497	5.7GB
6	NIR	448	3246	497	5.7GB
7	SWIR	215	3246	480	2.6GB
8	SWIR	215	3246	480	2.6GB

There are between 10 and 20 such products per day, constituting the bulk of
the data transmitted by the satellite.

Besides this nominal acquisition mode there are a few further modes named
IRRADIANCE, CALIBRATION and ENGINEERING, which take place once every 15 orbits
(approximately once per day).

The IRRADIANCE measures the spectrum of the sun at a particular date.  It is a
tiny dataset that concerns mostly the UV part of the spectrum, where the
irradiance varies in a meaningful way.

The CALIBRATION is a full-resolution full-spectrum dataset of about 20GB,
measuring the biases of each pixel.  It concerns mostly the IR part of the
spectrum, where the sensor is very delicate and subject to daily degradation.

The ENGINEERING dataset is acquired once per orbit, and it is a small dataset
of orbit calibration and instrument monitoring.

These four products together constitute the "L1b" data (the L0 data being the
unprocessed transmission from downlink, which is not publicly available).


L2 DATA
-------

The L1b RADIANCE images are huge and difficult to exploit directly.  Thus the
L2 product is computed from the L1b data and published a few hours later.
There is one or more separate L2 files for each gas.  They are low-resolution
geo-referenced images that take about 1MB each (more if the images contain
estimated atmospheric profiles instead of only the total column).

The algorithm to extract each gas concentration is conceptually simple.

1. callibrate the spectral data by removing biases in the IR channels
2. divide the radiance by the irradiance to obtain the reflectance
3. project the reflectance to the expected profile of each gas

The algorithms are in practice much more complicated, and they provide
additional measures of the credibility and noise for each concentration.  All
the algorithms are thoroughly described in the associated documentation for
each product.

These are the main L2 products:

	O3	ozone total column
	O3_TCL	ozone tropospheric column
	O3_PR	ozone profile
	O3_TPR	ozone tropospheric profile
	NO2	nitrogen diozide total and tropospheric columns
	SO2	sulfur dioxide total column
	CO	carbon monoxide total column
	CH4	methane total column
	HCHO	formaldehyde total column
	CLOUD	cloud fraction, albedo, top preassure
	AER_AI	UV aerosol index
	AER_LH	aerosol layer height (mid-level pressure)

We are mostly interested in CH4, but also in the NO2 images because they are
much more stable.
