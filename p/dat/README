These files contain spectral curves at two different sites and at two different
dates.

The sites are:

"c" : A green montanious range near Constantine, Algeria, lonlat = ( 2.72, 33 )

"k" : The Oil refinery at the east of Ouarga, Algeria, ( 6.21915, 31.8341 )


The two dates correspond to orbits numbered 11366 (december 2019) and 11550
(january 2020).  On the second date, a huge plume of methane was observed by
S5P at the K site.


The curves are extracted from the L1 product by running the following script:
