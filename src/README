The main program here is the "localize" executable.  It has several different
uses.  All of them require a single sentinel 5p image (either L1 or L2) and the
specification of a coordinate grid.

1. No-op

localize -180 180 -90 90 2000 1000 img.nc

# Does nothing.  Just loads the input data and exists.
# There are SEVEN obligatory input data
# -180 180 -90 90 : a lon/lat bounding box (this one means the whole globe)
# 2000 1000       : the width/height of the geographical grid inside the bbx
# img.nc          : the input S5P image in the format HDF5


2. Average summary (for radiances)

localize -180 180 -90 90 2000 1000 L1.nc -s out.npy

# build a summary image with the average of all the radiance samples
# this is usefol to get a quick view of a L1 band
# The file out.npy is a gray-level image with NANs where no data was available


3. Average summary (for methane)

localize -180 180 -90 90 2000 1000 L2_CH4.nc -s out.npy -d methane_mixing_ratio

# build a summary image with the methane mixing ratio
# the "-d" option selects the dataset of the file to localize
# (by default, it is "/radiance")


4. Hand-selected frequencies

localize -180 180 -90 90 2000 1000 L1.nc -s out.npy -sf "401 402 403 404 405"

# build a 5-channel image out.npy by slicing the given frequencies from the
# smile


5. Hand-selected pixel

localize -180 180 -90 90 2000 1000 L1.nc -s out.npy -p "lon lat" > curve.txt

# extract the whole spectrum (non-resampled) into a text file
